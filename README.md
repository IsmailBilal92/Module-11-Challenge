# Module-11-Challenge

This new assignment consists of two technical products. We should submit the following deliverables:
   
         -Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

         -Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

# Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News;

         1-Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
         2-Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website.
         3-Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that you scraped. Store the scraping results in Python data structures 
         4-Store the scraped data in a file

# Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data:
  
         1-Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data SiteLinks to an external site.. 
              Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape. 
              Note that the URL is https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html.

         2-Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to scrape the data in the HTML table. 
              Note that this can also be achieved by using the Pandas read_html function. 
              However, use Beautiful Soup here to continue sharpening your web scraping skills

         3-Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame. The columns should have the same headings as the table on the website.

         4-Examine the data types that are currently associated with each column.
